In this project, I analyze financial metrics such as Total Revenue, Paid Users count, and Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU).

**1. Calculated Fields:**
   - Total Revenue: the sum of all incomes.
   - Paid Users count: the number of paying users.
   - Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU): the average income per paying user, calculated as the total revenue divided by the number of paying users.

**2. Charts:**
   - Revenue by Location and Product Combination Chart. This chart visually compares the total revenue for each combination of location and product.
   - Revenue by Location Chart. Comparison of total revenue for each location.
   - Revenue by Month with Product Breakdown Chart. Each month is represented by color, and the height of the column shows the total revenue for that month. The breakdown by product is represented by color.
   - ARPPU and Paid Users Count by Month Chart. Graphs that visually show changes in the number of paying users and the average revenue per paying user for each month.
   - Box plot for Transaction Sum Comparison. The box plot displays the distribution of transaction sums over a certain period of time.
   - Chart Showing Changes in Each Location's Share of Revenue Over Time. This chart shows how each location's share of revenue changes relative to total revenue over time.

**3. Dashboard:**
   The dashboard contains sheets and filters with location, product, and date, which apply to all charts on the dashboard, allowing users to select and filter data by various parameters.

Analyzing these metrics will help understand which locations and products are the most profitable, how the number of paying users and their average revenue change over time, and how various factors impact the company's total revenue.
