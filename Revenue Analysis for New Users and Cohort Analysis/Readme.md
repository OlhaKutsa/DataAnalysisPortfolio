Project  **"Revenue Analysis for New Users and Cohort Analysis"**

The project focuses on analyzing revenue from new users and conducting cohort analysis. It includes sheets displaying monthly revenue from new users, total revenue dynamics, and cohort-based revenue analysis. These insights are consolidated into a dashboard with filters for location and date, facilitating comprehensive data exploration and analysis.

Sheet : **"MRR from New and Existing Users "**
This sheet displays the revenue generated from new users during each calendar month when they became paying customers. The calculation of this revenue involved using LOD (Level of Detail) functions to separately determine revenue from new users and revenue from existing users.This allows tracking the effectiveness of acquiring new clients and their contribution to the company's overall revenue.

Sheet : **" % Difference in Total Revenue to previous month"**
This sheet presents a report on total revenue. The vertical axis shows the total revenue, while the horizontal axis represents the percentage change in revenue compared to the previous month. This helps visualize the revenue dynamics and identify trends.

Sheet : **"Cohort Analysis of User Revenue"**
This sheet implements cohort analysis of user revenue. The rows of the table indicate the first month when a user became a paying customer, and the columns represent the number of months since the first payment month. The table displays the total revenue value for each period corresponding to the respective cohort. Additionally, the values in each cell are indicated by a gradient based on the ratio of revenue in the corresponding cell to the revenue in the first month of the cohort. This visually compares revenue between different cohorts and identifies consumption patterns.

**Dashboard:**
All three sheets are combined into one dashboard, allowing users to conveniently view and analyze the data. Filters by location and date are also added to the dashboard, enabling deeper data analysis by focusing on specific segments or time periods.
