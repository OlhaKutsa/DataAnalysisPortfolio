The project "Analysis of User Activity in Video Games by Age and Playtime" aims to study gamers across age categories and their gaming duration. By analyzing user activity data in games, we explore how different age groups spend time in video games, their preferences, and trends. The research results allow us to better understand which types of games are most popular among different age groups, how long players from different age categories spend time gaming, and what gaming habits are typical for various age segments. This information helps game developers optimize game design and create games that better cater to the needs and preferences of different age groups of players.
The project in Tableau includes the following steps:
1. **Sheet 1: Total Number of Game Users and Percentage of Users Playing "Battle pass"**
   - Displaying the total number of game users and the percentage of users playing "Battle pass" for each month.
   - Month-wise breakdown for analyzing changes over time.
2. **Sheet 2: Average Playtime per Player**
   - Calculating the average time spent by players in the game.
   - Adding a Label with the average number of hours and minutes in "HH:MM" format.
3. **Sheet 3: Heatmap of Player Activity by Age and Quarter**
   - Creating a heatmap with data on the average amount of time spent in the game by age group and quarter.
   - Age groups of players with a step of 5 years.
4. **Dashboard: Overall Report**
   - Combining all three sheets into one dashboard.
   - Adding filters for activity date, age group, and game title.
Each of these steps allows us to gain deeper insights into the gaming activity of players by their age and playtime, which can be valuable for marketing strategies and game design.
