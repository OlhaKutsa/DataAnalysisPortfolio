The project involved analyzing user registration and engagement data for a specific service or product. The main objectives were to track user behavior from registration to payment and to identify conversion rates at each step of the user journey.

Three Separate Blocks with Numbers:

Number of Registered Users

Number of Users Who Started Trial Period

Number of Users Who Made a Payment

Tooltips for the last two blocks display the conversion rate from registration to the respective step.

Graph with Registration Count and Conversion from Registration to Trial and  Payment in each Registration Month:

This graph displays the total number of registrations each month alongside the conversion rate from registration to trial and from registration to payment for each month. It provides insights into the effectiveness of user acquisition efforts and the conversion process.

Graph with Average Number of Days in every step from Registration to Payment in each Registration Month:

This graph illustrates the average number of days it takes for users to move from registration to payment for each registration month. It helps in understanding the user journey timeline and identifying any trends or patterns in user behavior.

Funnel Diagram:

The funnel diagram visualizes the user journey from registration to payment as a series of steps. It includes both absolute numbers (the number of users completing each step) and relative numbers (conversion rates) to provide a comprehensive view of the conversion process.

Conclusion:

Through this project, we were able to gain valuable insights into user behavior and conversion rates at different stages of the user journey. By tracking registration counts, trial conversions, and payment timelines, we identified areas for optimization and improvement in the user acquisition and engagement process. The funnel diagram provided a clear visualization of the conversion funnel, highlighting potential bottlenecks and areas of opportunity for increasing conversions. Overall, the analysis conducted in this project can inform strategic decision-making and drive initiatives aimed at enhancing user experience and maximizing conversion rates.
